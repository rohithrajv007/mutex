Here's a sample **README.md** file you can use for your Mutex Media Tools project:

# 🎬 Mutex Media Tools

A Flask-based web application that allows users to **extract audio** from videos or **replace a video’s audio track** entirely. This tool is perfect for content creators, educators, and developers looking for quick in-browser media editing capabilities.

## 🔧 Features

- 🎵 **Audio Extractor**:  
  Upload a video and extract its audio as a `.wav` file.

- 🔁 **Audio Replacer**:  
  Replace the audio in a video file with a new audio track. Supports trimming and previewing before download.

- 💡 **Simple Interface**:  
  Drag-and-drop support, inline previews, and download links for results.

- 🔒 **Secure & Session-based**:  
  Each operation uses a unique session ID and isolates file processing.

- 📁 Organized File Handling:  
  Files are saved in structured folders (`uploads/`, `audio/`, `processed/`).

- 📜 **Robust Logging & Error Handling**:  
  Logs every operation and handles missing files or system errors gracefully.
